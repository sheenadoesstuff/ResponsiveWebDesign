        When I took over, one of the bosses at the top said he had no doubt I
        could do the job but was worried the men working in the group might
        rebel. Well, they didn’t.

            Universal Systems Language (USL) and its associated automated
            environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her paradigm of
            development before the fact for systems design and software
            development.

        <blockquote>
          Margaret H. Hamilton led the team that created the on-board flight
          software for NASA's Apollo command modules and lunar modules. A
          mathematician and computer scientist who started her own software
          company, Hamilton contributed to concepts of asynchronous software,
          priority scheduling and priority displays, and human-in-the-loop
          decision capability, which set the foundation for modern,
          ultra-reliable software design and engineering.
