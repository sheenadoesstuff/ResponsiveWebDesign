        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: <code>Hypertext Preprocessor</code>)
          is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that
          is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into
          HTML.
        </p>
        <p>Nice, but what does that mean? An example:</p>
        <p>Example #1 An introductory example</p>
        <code> &lt;?php echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!"; ?&gt; </code>

        <p>
          Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP
          pages contain HTML with embedded code that does "something" (in this
          case, output "Hi, I'm a PHP script!"). The PHP code is enclosed in
          special start and end processing instructions
          <code>&lt;?php and ?&gt;</code> that allow you to jump into and out of
          "PHP mode."
        </p>
        <p>
          What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is
          that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then
          sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running
          that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. You can
          even configure your web server to process all your HTML files with
          PHP, and then there's really no way that users can tell what you have
          up your sleeve.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best part about using PHP is that it is extremely simple for a
          newcomer, but offers many advanced features for a professional
          programmer. Don't be afraid to read the long list of PHP's features.
          You can jump in, in a short time, and start writing simple scripts in
          a few hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although PHP's development is focused on server-side scripting, you
          can do much more with it. Read on, and see more in the What can PHP
          do? section, or go right to the introductory tutorial if you are only
          interested in web programming.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="What_can_PHP_do">
        <header><h2>What can PHP do</h2></header>
        <p>
          Anything. PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting, so you can
          do anything any other CGI program can do, such as collect form data,
          generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies. But PHP
          can do much more.
        </p>

        <p>There are three main areas where PHP scripts are used.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Server-side scripting. This is the most traditional and main target
            field for PHP. You need three things to make this work: the PHP
            parser (CGI or server module), a web server and a web browser. You
            need to run the web server, with a connected PHP installation. You
            can access the PHP program output with a web browser, viewing the
            PHP page through the server. All these can run on your home machine
            if you are just experimenting with PHP programming. See the
            installation instructions section for more information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Command line scripting. You can make a PHP script to run it without
            any server or browser. You only need the PHP parser to use it this
            way. This type of usage is ideal for scripts regularly executed
            using cron (on *nix or Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows). These
            scripts can also be used for simple text processing tasks. See the
            section about Command line usage of PHP for more information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Writing desktop applications. PHP is probably not the very best
            language to create a desktop application with a graphical user
            interface, but if you know PHP very well, and would like to use some
            advanced PHP features in your client-side applications you can also
            use PHP-GTK to write such programs. You also have the ability to
            write cross-platform applications this way. PHP-GTK is an extension
            to PHP, not available in the main distribution. If you are
            interested in PHP-GTK, visit » its own website.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          PHP can be used on all major operating systems, including Linux, many
          Unix variants (including HP-UX, Solaris and OpenBSD), Microsoft
          Windows, macOS, RISC OS, and probably others. PHP also has support for
          most of the web servers today. This includes Apache, IIS, and many
          others. And this includes any web server that can utilize the FastCGI
          PHP binary, like lighttpd and nginx. PHP works as either a module, or
          as a CGI processor.
        </p>
        <p>
          So with PHP, you have the freedom of choosing an operating system and
          a web server. Furthermore, you also have the choice of using
          procedural programming or object-oriented programming (OOP), or a
          mixture of them both.
        </p>
        <p>
          With PHP you are not limited to output HTML. PHP's abilities includes
          outputting images, PDF files and even Flash movies (using libswf and
          Ming) generated on the fly. You can also output easily any text, such
          as XHTML and any other XML file. PHP can autogenerate these files, and
          save them in the file system, instead of printing it out, forming a
          server-side cache for your dynamic content.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the strongest and most significant features in PHP is its
          support for a wide range of databases. Writing a database-enabled web
          page is incredibly simple using one of the database specific
          extensions (e.g., for mysql), or using an abstraction layer like PDO,
          or connect to any database supporting the Open Database Connection
          standard via the ODBC extension. Other databases may utilize cURL or
          sockets, like CouchDB.
        </p>
        <p>
          PHP also has support for talking to other services using protocols
          such as LDAP, IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, HTTP, COM (on Windows) and
          countless others. You can also open raw network sockets and interact
          using any other protocol. PHP has support for the WDDX complex data
          exchange between virtually all Web programming languages. Talking
          about interconnection, PHP has support for instantiation of Java
          objects and using them transparently as PHP objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          PHP has useful text processing features, which includes the Perl
          compatible regular expressions (PCRE), and many extensions and tools
          to parse and access XML documents. PHP standardizes all of the XML
          extensions on the solid base of libxml2, and extends the feature set
          adding SimpleXML, XMLReader and XMLWriter support.
        </p>
        <p>
          And many other interesting extensions exist, which are categorized
          both alphabetically and by category. And there are additional PECL
          extensions that may or may not be documented within the PHP manual
          itself, like » XDebug.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see this page is not enough to list all the features and
          benefits PHP can offer. Read on in the sections about installing PHP,
          and see the function reference part for explanation of the extensions
          mentioned here.

          Here we would like to show the very basics of PHP in a short, simple
          tutorial. This text only deals with dynamic web page creation with
          PHP, though PHP is not only capable of creating web pages. See the
          section titled What can PHP do for more information.
        </p>
        <p>
          PHP-enabled web pages are treated just like regular HTML pages and you
          can create and edit them the same way you normally create regular HTML
          pages.

        <p>
          In this tutorial we assume that your server has activated support for
          PHP and that all files ending in .php are handled by PHP. On most
          servers, this is the default extension for PHP files, but ask your
          server administrator to be sure. If your server supports PHP, then you
          do not need to do anything. Just create your .php files, put them in
          your web directory and the server will automatically parse them for
          you. There is no need to compile anything nor do you need to install
          any extra tools. Think of these PHP-enabled files as simple HTML files
          with a whole new family of magical tags that let you do all sorts of
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us say you want to save precious bandwidth and develop locally. In
          this case, you will want to install a web server, such as » Apache,
          and of course » PHP. You will most likely want to install a database
          as well, such as » MySQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can either install these individually or choose a simpler way. Our
          manual has installation instructions for PHP (assuming you already
          have some web server set up). If you have problems with installing PHP
          yourself, we would suggest you ask your questions on our »
          installation mailing list. If you choose to go on the simpler route,
          then » locate a pre-configured package for your operating system,
          which automatically installs all of these with just a few mouse
          clicks. It is easy to setup a web server with PHP support on any
          operating system, including MacOSX, Linux and Windows. On Linux, you
          may find » rpmfind and » PBone helpful for locating RPMs. You may also
          want to visit » apt-get to find packages for Debian.

      <section class="main-section" id="Your_first_PHP-enabled_page">
        <header><h2>Your first PHP-enabled page</h2></header>
        <p>
          Create a file named hello.php and put it in your web server's root
          directory (<code>DOCUMENT_ROOT</code>) with the following content:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;PHP Test &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    <span class="php-code">&lt;?php echo ' &lt;p&gt;Hello World &lt;/p&gt;'; ?&gt;</span> 
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
        <p>
          Use your browser to access the file with your web server's URL, ending
          with the /hello.php file reference. When developing locally this URL
          will be something like http://localhost/hello.php or
          http://127.0.0.1/hello.php but this depends on the web server's
          configuration. If everything is configured correctly, this file will
          be parsed by PHP and the following output will be sent to your
          browser:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;PHP Test&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          This program is extremely simple and you really did not need to use
          PHP to create a page like this. All it does is display: Hello World
          using the PHP echo statement. Note that the file does not need to be
          executable or special in any way. The server finds out that this file
          needs to be interpreted by PHP because you used the ".php" extension,
          which the server is configured to pass on to PHP. Think of this as a
          normal HTML file which happens to have a set of special tags available
          to you that do a lot of interesting things.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you tried this example and it did not output anything, it prompted
          for download, or you see the whole file as text, chances are that the
          server you are on does not have PHP enabled, or is not configured
          properly. Ask your administrator to enable it for you using the
          Installation chapter of the manual. If you are developing locally,
          also read the installation chapter to make sure everything is
          configured properly. Make sure that you access the file via http with
          the server providing you the output. If you just call up the file from
          your file system, then it will not be parsed by PHP. If the problems
          persist anyway, do not hesitate to use one of the many » PHP support
          options.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point of the example is to show the special PHP tag format. In
          this example we used
          <code>&lt;?php</code> to indicate the start of a PHP tag. Then we put
          the PHP statement and left PHP mode by adding the closing tag,<code>
            ?&gt;</code
          >. You may jump in and out of PHP mode in an HTML file like this
          anywhere you want. For more details, read the manual section on the
          basic PHP syntax.
